Purpose:

Analysis:

•	Which neighborhoods are most in demand?
•	What other ways can we look at improving the Bluebikes program?

Conclusion:
•	100 stations will cost roughly $7 Million
•	Most rides are occurring in downtown Boston, Back Bay, Cambridge
•	Top neighborhoods by demand score (% of rides that occurred in neighborhood / % of total stations in neighborhood):
    Beacon Hill
    North End
    Downtown Crossing
    Back Bay
    Downtown
    West End
•	Best Neighborhoods to build stations in to maximize demand:
    Back Bay

    West End
•	Other methods to maximize revenue:
    Rides by time throughout the date highlights use of Bluebikes for commuting
